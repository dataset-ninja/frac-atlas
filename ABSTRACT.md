The authors present **FracAtlas: A Dataset for Fracture Classification, Localization and Segmentation of Musculoskeletal Radiographs**, a dataset of X-Ray scans curated from the images collected from 3 major hospitals in Bangladesh. Digital radiography is one of the most common and cost-effective standards for the diagnosis of bone fractures. For such diagnoses expert intervention is required which is time-consuming and demands rigorous training. With the recent growth of computer vision algorithms, there is a surge of interest in computer-aided diagnosis. The development of algorithms demands large datasets with proper annotations. Existing X-Ray datasets are either small or lack proper annotation, which hinders the development of machine-learning algorithms and evaluation of the relative performance of algorithms for classification,localization, and segmentation. Their dataset includes 4,083 images that have been manually annotated for bone fracture classification, localization, and segmentation with the help of 2 expert radiologists and an orthopedist using the open-source labeling platform, makesense.ai. There are 717 images with 922 instances of fractures. Each of the fracture instances has its own mask and bounding box, whereas the scans also have global labels for classification tasks. 


## Dataset creation

The authors have created the FracAtlas dataset in four main steps: 
1) data collection - general purpose X-ray images were collected in DICOM format and for de-identification, the images were converted to JPG and were given arbitrary names,
2) data cleaning - the resultant JPG image set was filtered out from other body parts,
3) finding the general distribution of cleaned data - the resulting image set was taken back to the respective hospitals to find out the general distribution,
4) annotation of the dataset - the resulting image set was annotated by 2 expert radiologists and later verified and merged by an expert orthopedic doctor.

Throughout the years 2021 and 2022, approximately 14,068 X-ray scans were collected from 3 hospitals and diagnostic centers. Most of the scans were collected from Lab-Aid Medical Center, Brahmanbaria, along with Anupam General Hospital and Diagnostic Center, Bogra and Prime Diagnostic Center, Barishal. The acquired DICOM images were generated by Fujifilm and Philips devices. The ethical clearance of this study was approved by Institutional Research Ethics Board (IREB) according to the Bangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC). The IREB approved the open publication of the data based on the facts that there are adequate provisions to maintain the confidentiality of the individuals through proper filtration of personally identifiable information. Furthermore, the permission of publishing the data to the public domain was also taken at the source. Consent for data collection for all subjects (adults and parents in the case of minors)  was taken as part of the initiation of the diagnosis at the medical facilities. In the initial phase, a total of 14,068 X-Rays were collected. As the hospitals and diagnostic centers could not share patient information due to privacy concerns, all the DICOM images were given an arbitrary image name and converted to JPG image format. This automatically got rid of all the sensitive information that was present in the metadata of DICOM images. This left authors with 4,083 scans from the hand, leg, hip and shoulder regions.

## Dataset distribution

There are 717 abnormal scans in dataset which contain a total of 922 instances of fractures. The abnormal studies contain at least 1 and at most 5 fracture instances in them. Some of the scans have multiple views and locales in them. There are 396 images with different views of the same organ in the same image. There are 99 images with Orthopedic Fixation Devices (hardware) in them. The FracAtlas dataset19 has a total of 1,538 scans of the hand and among them, 437 are fractured. There is a total of 2,272 leg scans, 338 hip scans and 349 shoulder scans. Among these, the number of scans belonging fractured class is 263, 63 and 63 for the leg, hip and shoulder regions respectively, marked with ***hand***, ***leg***, ***hip***, ***shoulder*** and ***fractured*** tags respectively.

<span style="font-size: smaller; font-style: italic;">The distribution of different locales along with other properties present in the images of the FracAtlas dataset.</span>

The FracAtlas dataset comprises a total of 2,503 frontal, 1,492 lateral, and 418 oblique view images, each pertaining to different organs, they marked with ***frontal***, ***lateral*** and ***oblique*** tags respectively. Whereas the ‘Fractured’ class includes 438 frontal, 325 lateral, and 45 oblique view images. Conversely, the ‘Non-fractured’ class encompasses a total of 2,065 frontal, 1,167 lateral, and 373 oblique views.

## Dataset labeling

The distribution analysis of the data was followed by a review process by two expert radiologists, each with years of experience in the field. The radiologists went through all 4,083 images and labeled each image by identifying the presence and number of fractures, along with the location name of the fractures. After full observation, the fracture list generated by each radiologist was cross-checked with one another. The images that had unanimous labels provided by the radiologists were taken as fractured scans. In case of any disparities in the location of fractures or the count of fracture locales, the images were referred to an expert orthopedic surgeon for further review and validation. After labeling those listed images independently, the images were again cross-checked with his own findings to the ones generated by the radiologists. And after comparing all 3 samples the final labels were agreed upon. After resolving all conflicts, the images were manually annotated. Each image can have multiple locales marked by separate masks and different masks are also allowed to overlap. Thre number of fracture is marked by ***fracture_count*** tag.
