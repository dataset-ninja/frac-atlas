**FracAtlas: A Dataset for Fracture Classification, Localization and Segmentation of Musculoskeletal Radiographs** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 4083 images with 1844 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*fractured*).

Images in the FracAtlas dataset have . There are 3366 (82% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 4 splits in the dataset: *not fractured* (3366 images), *train* (574 images), *val* (82 images), and *test* (61 images). Additionally, the images have tags, representing whether a scan has ***hand***, ***leg***, ***hip*** or ***shoulder*** region present in it. Images also has a ***hardware*** tag corresponding to the availability of Orthopedic Fixation Devices in the scan. Some images have multiple views of the same organ projected from the frontal and sagittal planes. Those images can be identified using the ***multiscan*** tag. The ***fractured*** tag represents if a scan has fractures in it. The ***fracture_count*** tag representing the number of fracture instances present in image. The ***frontal***, ***lateral*** and ***oblique*** tags represent the perspectives present in image. The dataset was released in 2023 by the Islamic University of Technology, Gazipur, Bangladesh and United International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh.
