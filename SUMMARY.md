**FracAtlas: A Dataset for Fracture Classification, Localization and Segmentation of Musculoskeletal Radiographs** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification tasks. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 4083 images with 1844 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*fractured*).

Images in the FracAtlas dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation and bounding box annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation task (only one mask for every class). There are 3366 (82% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 4 splits in the dataset: *not fractured* (3366 images), *train* (574 images), *val* (82 images), and *test* (61 images). Additionally, images also has a ***hardware*** tag corresponding to the availability of Orthopedic Fixation Devices in the scan. Some images have multiple views of the same organ projected from the frontal and sagittal planes, those images can be identified using the ***multiscan*** tag. Images, containing multiple body parts, are marked by ***mixed*** tag. The dataset was released in 2023 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Islamic University of Technology, Gazipur, Bangladesh</span> and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">United International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh</span>.
